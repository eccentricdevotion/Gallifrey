## Installation

Click the green __Clone or download__ button above right, then the __Download ZIP__ link, then un-zip the file to your `.minecraft/resourcepacks` folder

## Alternate installation and keeping up-to-date

As the TARDIS resource packs are shared in GitHub repositories. If you install a GitHub client, you can easily keep your resource packs current by syncing with any changes that are pushed to the repository.

Here's a quick run down on doing that:

1. Download and install the GitHub client for your operating system:
   * [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/)
   * [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)
2. Start GitHub client and create a free GitHub account (if you don’t have one)
3. In your web browser, navigate to the TARDIS resource pack repositories
   * Gallifrey (You are here)
   * [Skaro](https://github.com/eccentricdevotion/Skaro)
   * [TARDIS-Resource-Pack](https://github.com/eccentricdevotion/TARDIS-Resource-Pack)
   * [TARDIS-Sounds](https://github.com/eccentricdevotion/TARDIS-SoundResourcePack)
   * [TARDISWeepingAngels](https://github.com/eccentricdevotion/TARDISWeepingAngels-Resource-Pack) - you only need this if you don't have the TARDIS-Resource-Pack...
4. Click the green __Clone or download__ button, then the __Open in Desktop__ link
5. Save the repository clone in the minecraft/resourcepacks folder
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each resource pack
7. To update the resource pack, use the desktop client to ‘Pull’ in any changes.
   * Command-Shift-P on a Mac
   * Control-Shift-P on Windows
